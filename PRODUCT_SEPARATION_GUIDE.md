## 🎯 How to Use

### For Customers:
1. **Visit the Shop page** at http://localhost/
2. **Click on tabs** to filter products:
   - **All Products** - See everything
   - **Women's** - See only women's items
   - **Men's** - See only men's items
3. **Look for badges** on product images to quickly identify categories

### For Developers:
The filtering is done in `src/pages/Shop.tsx`:

```typescript
const filterProductsByGender = (gender: 'all' | 'women' | 'men') => {
  if (gender === 'all') return products;
  
  return products.filter(product => {
    const category = (product as any).category?.toLowerCase() || '';
    return category === gender;
  });
};
```

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Category Badge Colors:
```typescript
const colors = {
  men: 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800',      // Blue for men
  women: 'bg-pink-100 text-pink-800',    // Pink for women
  unisex: 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800',   // Gray for unisex
};
```

### Badge Position:
- Located in the **top-right corner** of each product image
- Visible on hover and always displayed
- Responsive and works on all screen sizes

## 📱 Responsive Design

The product grid adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Mobile (sm)**: 2 columns
- **Tablet (lg)**: 3 columns
- **Desktop (xl)**: 4 columns

## 🔄 Adding New Products

When adding new products, make sure to include the `category` field:

```javascript
{
  name: "Product Name",
  description: "Product description",
  price: 99.99,
  stock: 50,
  image_url: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  category: "men" // or "women" or "unisex"
}
```

## 🛠️ Database Schema

The Product model includes the category field:

```javascript
category: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['men', 'women', 'unisex'],
  default: 'unisex',
}
```

## 🚀 Testing the Separation

1. **Open the shop**: http://localhost/
2. **Click "All Products"** - Should show 20 products
3. **Click "Women's"** - Should show 10 women's products with pink badges
4. **Click "Men's"** - Should show 10 men's products with blue badges

## 📊 API Endpoint

Products are fetched from: `GET /api/products`

Each product includes:
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "name": "Men's Classic White T-Shirt",
  "description": "...",
  "price": 24.99,
  "stock": 100,
  "image_url": "...",
